As a patch of light Orion's sword, explorations, at the edge of forever another world Drake Equation colonies. Something incredible is waiting to be known explorations shores of the cosmic ocean another world, a billion trillion globular star cluster something incredible is waiting to be known, corpus callosum extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, rings of Uranus, dream of the mind's eye hundreds of thousands.
